# Decoding-Payee-and-GL-from-Vendor-Transaction-Records
This project involves mapping the Payee and GL for each vendor. The process uses the vendor master Excel file, which contains Payee and GL information based on the transaction history of all clients. The bot will map the Payee and GL for each vendor from the vendor master Excel file based on the transaction keyword.
